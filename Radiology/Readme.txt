There is a python package called nipype which has inbuilt fsl functionalities. Using the inbuilt functions of nipype the following processes are carried out for segmentation of tumour/lesion part of the image.

Step-1:

All the three T1, T2 and FLAIR images are co-registered using T1C as reference image since T1C has better results compared to others(as suggested by doctors).FLIRT command of FSL is used for this purpose.

Step-2:

Next T1C is given as input for BET command of FSL. This adjusts the threshold for the extraction to assure that the skull is removed while cortical surface is left intact.

Step-3:

Then the output of BET command is fed to FAST command of FSL as input with input specifications such as number of classes=4 and number of iterations=8(for better performance). This generates four segmented images each image highlighting CSF, Grey matter, White matter and lesion parts. Out of four images pve_1 generated highlights lesions.

Step-4:

There is a package called med2image. This helps in converting Nifti volumesâ€™ all the individual slices into jpg format. Then the pve_1 image is separated into slices and intermediary slices are taken for feature vector extraction.
